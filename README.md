# Add to Cart App

The **Add to Cart App** is a simple Android application that allows users to add items to their shopping list. The app is built using **Android Kotlin** and leverages **Room Database** to store user data locally. Users can easily add, edit, and delete items from their shopping cart.

## Features

- **Add Items to Cart**: 
  - Users can tap the **Add to Cart** button to enter the item they want to add and specify the quantity.
  
- **Cart Management**:
  - After adding an item, users can see a **card** displaying the added item and its quantity.
  - Each item has options to **Edit** or **Delete**.

- **Local Storage**:
  - The app uses **Room Database** to store cart items locally on the device.

## Screens and Functionalities

- **Add to Cart Button**:
  - Tapping this button reveals two fields:
    1. **Item Name**: The item the user wants to add.
    2. **Quantity**: The quantity of the item to add.
  - Two action buttons appear:
    - **Add**: Saves the item to the cart and shows it on the screen.
    - **Cancel**: Closes the input fields without adding anything.

- **Cart Screen**:
  - Displays each added item in a card format.
  - Each card shows:
    - The **Item Name**.
    - The **Quantity** of the item.
    - **Edit** and **Delete** options for managing the cart.

- **Edit and Delete**:
  - **Edit**: Allows the user to modify the item name or quantity.
  - **Delete**: Removes the item from the cart.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Kotlin**: Primary language for Android development.
- **Room Database**: Used for storing cart items locally.
- **Jetpack Components**: For efficient handling of UI components.
- **Material Design**: Provides a user-friendly interface with modern UI elements.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
Open the project in Android Studio.
Sync Gradle files and build the project.
Run the project on an emulator or physical device.

Usage
Launch the App.
Tap the Add to Cart button to add a new item to your shopping list.
Enter the Item Name and Quantity, then click Add to store the item.
The item will appear in the cart with options to Edit or Delete.
Use Edit to change the item details or Delete to remove the item from the cart.
Room Database Setup
The app uses Room Database to persist user data locally. This ensures that the cart items remain available even after the app is closed.

Future Enhancements
Add the ability to sync the cart with a remote server or cloud database.
Implement a feature for categorizing items (e.g., groceries, electronics, etc.).
Add a search functionality to find items in the cart easily.
